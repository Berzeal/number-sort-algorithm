# Number Sort Algorithm

This project is a simple implementation of a number sorting algorithm, built as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

The program takes a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending or descending order using a custom sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS (if any user interface is included)
- Node.js (optional, if you ran it from terminal)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-sort-algorithm.git
   cd number-sort-algorithm
